understandable, given that often the best experience one can have with insurance is not to receive the bene˜ts of the product at all, after a disaster or other loss. and othersšwho already have some understanding or even appreciation for insurancešmight say it provides protection against ˜nancial aspects of a premature death, injury, loss of property, loss of earning power, legal liability or other unexpected expenses. all that is true. we are the ˜nancial ˜rst responders. but there is so much more.insurance drives economic growth. it provides stability against risks. it encourages resilience. recent disasters have demonstrated the vital role the industry plays in recoveryšand that without insurance, the impact on individuals, businesses and communities can be devastating. as insurers, we know that even with all that we protect now, the coverage gap is still too big. we want to close that gap. that desire is re˚ected in changes to this year™s insurance information institute (i.i.i.) insurance fact book. we have added new information on coastal storm surge risk and hail as well as reinsurance and the growing problem of marijuana and impaired driving. we have updated the section on litigiousness to include tort costs and compensation by state, and assignment of bene˜ts litigation, a growing problem in florida.as always, the book provides valuable

'chapter 3distributionproperty/casualtyoverviewmany insurance companies use a number of di˜erent channels to distribute their products. in the early days of the u.s. insurance industry, insurers hired agents, often on a part-time basis, to sign up applicants for insurance. some agents, known now as captive or exclusive agents, represented a single company. others, the equivalent of today™s independent agents, worked for a number of companies. at the same time that the two agency systems were expanding, commercial insurance brokers, who were often underwriters, began to establish themselves in cities. while agents usually represented insurers, brokers represented clients who were buying insurance. these three distribution channels (captive agents, independent agents and brokers) exist in much the same form today. also, with the development of information technology, alternative distribution channels sprang up, including direct sales by telephone, mail and the internet. insurers also use other types of outlets, such as banks, workplaces, associa-tions and car dealers, to access potential policyholders.online property/casualty insurance salesonline insurance distribution systems have evolved to include any device consumers use to conduct businessšmobile devices, tablets and pcs. however, there is ongoing evidence that insurer websites are not meeting customer expecta-tions, according to the j.d. power and associates 2018 insurance digital experience study. j.d. power included customers of the 19 largest property/casualty insurance companies and used responses from over 11,000 people in february and march 2018. the study found that insurance customer expectations are being in˚uenced by the user experience of all-digital brands such as amazon and net˚ix, and many insurers are falling short. insurers have created attractive user  interfaces but these lack functionality, for example when processing claims, servicing policies or shopping. overall insur-ance shopping experience was measured on a 1,000-point scale. the industry average was 779, driven by strong perfor-mance in three key shopping factorsšease of navigation, availability of key information and the clarity of that information. consumer appetite for digital experiences seems to be growing, according to a survey from the insurance research council (irc), which polled 2,000 people online about their auto insurance preferences. of the 69 percent of respondents who said they had communicated with their auto insurer in the previous year to perform various tasks, most said they had communicated by phone. checking claim status and obtaining a certi˛cate of insurance were the only tasks where 30 percent or more used a digital method, de˛ned as email, website or mobile app. for almost every task covered by the survey there were more people who indicated a preference for using digital methods in the future than those who reported using digital methods in the previous year. the insurance information institute™s pulse poll found that among policyholders who compared prices for auto and homeowners insurance at renewal, talking to an agent in person was the preferred method of comparing prices. in november 2015, 69 percent of respondents who were auto insurance customers compared prices, and 50 percent said they talked to an agent in person. more than one-third (39 percent) went online to compare prices and about the same number (37 percent) telephoned. (respondents could report more than one method.) ˝˙insurance information institute | www.iii.org ˙ˆˇ˘ insurance fact book ˝˙', 'of the 44 percent of homeowner policyholders who checked prices in may

agencies in the united states in 2018, down from 38,000 in 2016, according to the independent insurance agents and brokers of america™s (iiaba) 2018 agency universe survey.the iiaba says the 2018 decrease primarily re˚ects a new data resource providing more accurate and insurance industry-focused data, along with increased mergers and acquisitions.in 2018 the estimated percent-age of small agencies (less than $150,000 in revenue) accounted for 35 percent of all agencies, while jumbo agencies (revenue of $10 million or more) accounted for 2 percent of agencies.the proportion of agencies in small towns and rural areas returned to 19 percent in 2018, where it had been in 2014, after falling to 9 percent in 2016. about half (51 percent) of agencies are in large metropol-itan areas.in

401(k)s/mutual funds', 'annuitiessales of fixed and variable annuitiesannuities play an important role in retirement planning by helping individuals guard against outliving their assets. in the most general sense, an annuity is an agreement for an entity (generally a life insurance company) to pay another entity a series of payments. while there are many types of annuities, key features can include tax savings, protection from creditors, invest-ment options, lifetime income and bene˜ts to heirs. among the most common types of annuities are ˜xed and variable. fixed annuities guarantee the principal and a minimum rate of interest. generally, interest credited and payments made from a ˜xed annuity are based on rates declared by the company, which can change only yearly. in contrast, variable annuity account values and payments are based on the performance of a separate investment portfolio; thus their value may ˚uctuate daily. there is a variety of ˜xed annuities and variable annuities. one type of ˜xed annuity, the equity indexed annuity, contains features of ˜xed and variable annuities. it provides a base return, just as other ˜xed annuities do, but its value is also based on the performance of a speci˜ed stock index. the return can go higher if the index rises. the 2010 dodd-frank act included language keeping equity indexed annuities under state insurance regulation. variable annuities are subject to both state insurance regulation and federal securities regulation. fixed annuities are not considered securities and are only subject to state insurance regulation. annuities can be deferred or immediate. deferred annuities generally accumulate assets over a long period of time, with withdrawals taken as a single sum or as an income payment beginning at retirement. immediate annuities allow purchasers to convert a lump sum payment into a stream of income that begins right away. annuities can be written on an individual or group basis. (see the life/health premiums by line table.) annuities can be used to fund structured settlements, arrangements in which an injury victim in a lawsuit receives compensation in a number of tax-free payments over time, rather than as a lump sum.individual annuity considerations, 2013-20171 ($ billions)yearvariable fixedtotalamountpercent change from prior year˜˚˛˝$˛˙ˆ.˙ $ˇ˙.˙ $˜˜˘.ˇ

assets, traditional life insurance is no longer the primary business of many companies in the life/health insurance industry. the emphasis has shifted to the underwriting of annuities. annuities are contracts that accumulate funds and/or pay out a ˜xed or variable income stream. an income stream can be for a set period of time or over the lifetimes of the contract holder or his or her bene˜ciaries. nevertheless, traditional life insurance products such as universal life and term life for individuals as well as group life remain an important part of the business, as do disability income and health insurance. besides annuities and life insurance products, life insurers may o˚er other types of ˜nancial services such as asset management.2017 financial resultsaccording to s&p

vigorously to increase market share. as the market softens to the point that pro˜ts diminish or vanish completely, the capital needed to underwrite new business is depleted. in the up phase of the cycle, competition is less intense, underwriting standards become more stringent, the supply of insurance is limited due to the depletion of capital, and, as a result, premiums rise. the prospect of higher pro˜ts draws more capital into the marketplace, leading to more competition and the inevitable down phase of the cycle. the chart below shows both nominal and in˚ation-adjusted growth of p/c net premiums written over four decades and three hard markets. premiums can be accounted for in several ways. this chart uses net premiums written, which re˚ect premium amounts after deductions for

pennsylvaniašhave separate pre-assessment funds for workers compensation. florida has a post-assessment fund, which covers the claims of insolvent workers compensation insurers and self-insurers.  the p/c lines of insurance covered by guaranty funds and the maximum amount paid on any claim vary from state to state. assessments are used to pay claims against companies that became insolvent in the past as well as for current insolvencies. a similar system for life and health insurers is coordinated by the national organization of life and health insurance guaranty associations.property/casualty

comprehensive coverage. the average expenditure measures what consumers actually spend for insurance. expenditures are a˘ected by the coverages purchased as well as other factors. in states with a healthy economy, people are more likely to purchase new cars. since new car owners are more likely to purchase physical damage coverages, these states will have a higher average expenditure. the naic

insurance companies doing business in the state. in the voluntary, or regular, market, auto insurers are free to select policyholders. the percentage of vehicles insured in the shared market is dropping, in part because of the evolution of the nonstandard sector of the voluntary market. the nonstandard market is a niche market for drivers who have a worse than average driving record or drive

companies with nonstandard divisions.insured vehiclesin 2015, 203 million private passenger vehicles were insured in the united states excluding texas, up from 198 million in 2014, according to latest

association; state departments of insurance.insurance information institute | www.iii.org ˝˙˚ˆ insurance fact book 7. property/casualty insurance by lineauto: laws', 'state auto insurance laws governing liability coveragestate auto insurance laws governing liability coverage fall into four broad categories: no-fault, choice no-fault, tort liability and add-on. the major di˘erences are whether there are restrictions on the right to sue and whether the policyholder™s own insurer pays ˇrst-party (i.e., the insured™s) beneˇts, up to the state maximum amount, regardless  of who is at fault in the accident.no-fault: the no-fault system is intended to lower the cost of auto insurance by taking small claims out of the courts. each insurance company compensates its own policyholders for the cost of minor injuries regardless of who was at fault in the accident. these ˇrst-party beneˇts, known as personal injury protection (pip), are a mandatory coverage in no-fault states but beneˇts vary by state. in states with the most extensive beneˇts, a policyholder receives compensation for medical fees, lost wages, funeral costs and other out-of-pocket expenses. the term no-fault can be confusing because it is often used to denote any auto insurance system in which each driver™s own insurance company pays for certain losses, regardless of fault. in its strict form, the term no-fault applies only to states where insurance companies pay ˇrst-party beneˇts and where there are restrictions on the right to sue. victims in no-fault states may sue for severe injuries if the case meets certain conditions. these conditions are known as the tort liability threshold, and may be expressed in verbal terms such as death or signiˇcant disˇgurement (verbal threshold) or in dollar amounts of medical bills (monetary threshold).choice no-fault: in choice no-fault states, drivers may select one of two options: a no-fault auto insurance policy, usually with a verbal threshold, or a traditional tort liability policy.tort liability: in traditional tort liability states, there are no restrictions on lawsuits. a policyholder at fault in a car crash can be sued by the other driver

factors: real estate values; building and  construction costs; vulnerability to catastrophes; degree of urbanization; and the legal, regulatory and economic climate. these factors result in wide

excluded under standard homeowners and renters insurance policies. however, ˛ood coverage is available in the form of a separate policy both from the national flood insurance program (nfip) and from some private insurers. congress created the nfip in 1968 in response to the rising cost of taxpayer-funded disaster relief for ˛ood victims and the increasing amount of damage caused by ˛oods. the nfip makes federally backed ˛ood insurance available in communities that agree to adopt and enforce ˛oodplain management ordinances to reduce future ˛ood damage. the nfip is self-supporting for the average historical loss year. this means that unless there is a widespread disaster, operating expenses and ˛ood insurance claims are ˇnanced through premiums collected. in 2016 the national flood insurance program (nfip) put a reinsurance program in place to better manage the losses it incurred from major events by transferring exposure to reinsurers. in january 2017 fema transferred $1.02 billion of the nfip™s ˇnancial risk to 25 reinsurers. the nfip recovered the entire $1.02 billion based on hurricane harvey ˛ood losses. the nfip returned to the private reinsurance market in 2018, paying  $235 million for $1.458 billion in coverage from a single ˛ood event from 28 reinsurers. the structure of 2018™s reinsurance changed from 2017, when reinsurers covered  26 percent of the $4 billion in losses after nfip retained the ˇrst $4 billion in losses. for 2018 losses reinsurers will pay 18.6 percent of the ˇrst $2 billion of losses in excess of  $4 billion and 54.3 percent of the next $2 billion in excess of $6 billion, up to a maximum of $1.46 billion. in both 2017 and 2018 the nfip got no protection for the ˇrst $4 billion  of any ˛ood event. fema is expected to obtain reinsurance for 2019 in the beginning  of the year. in august 2018 fema launched its ˇrst catastrophe bond to transfer risk from the nfip to the capital markets. it was the ˇrst catastrophe bond to provide reinsurance coverage solely for ˛ood risks. fema obtained $500 million of reinsurance protection from the floodsmart re ltd. (series 2018-1 issuance). the transaction, from floodsmart re, which is a bermuda domiciled special purpose insurance vehicle, will cover nfip losses from ˛ood events that are directly or indirectly caused by a named storm event impacting the united states including puerto rico, the u.s. virgin islands and the district of columbia. congress must periodically renew the nfip™s statutory authority to operate. in the unlikely event the nfip™s authorization lapses, claims would still be paid but the nfip would stop selling and renewing policies (more details here). the 2018 insurance information institute pulse survey found that 15 percent of american homeowners had a ˛ood insurance policy, up from 12 percent who had the coverage in 2016, as shown in the following chart.˚˝˙insurance

linecommercial lines', 'financial guaranty insurancefinancial guaranty insurance, also known as bond insurance, helps expand ˇnancial markets by increasing borrower and lender leverage. it guarantees the principal and interest payments on municipal obligations. financial guaranty insurers are specialized, highly capitalized companies that traditionally had the highest rating. the insurer™s high rating attaches to the bonds thus lowering the risk of the bonds to investors. with their credit rating thus enhanced, municipalities can issue bonds that pay a lower interest rate, enabling them to borrow more for the same outlay of funds. the combined ratio climbed to 421.4 in 2008 at the height of the economic downturn. in 2013 the combined ratio fell below zero as several companies reduced loss reserves by more than $2 billion combined as a result of strains created by the ˇnancial crisis. over the years ˇnancial guaranty insurers have expanded their reach beyond municipal bonds and now insure a wide array of products, including mortgage-backed securities, pools of credit default swaps and other structured transactions.financial guaranty insurance, 2008-20171 ($000)yearnet premiums

away dead wood and undergrowth to make way for younger trees. but for much of the last century, ˜re-suppression policies have sought to extinguish wild˜res as quickly as possible to preserve timber and real estate. this approach has led to the accumulation of brush and other vegetation that is easily ignited and serves as fuel for wild˜res. most of the large ˜res with signi˜cant property damage have occurred in california, where some of the fastest developing counties are in forest areas that were once largely unin-habited. these areas, known as the wildland-urban interface (wui), contain about 44 million houses in the lower 48 states, according to the u.s. forest service. rising temperatures are also believed to contribute to large, destructive blazes. warmer weather contributes to wild˜re conditions in several ways: dryer and more combustible vegetation, more frequent lightning strikes, an extended ˜re season; and more intense winds. harvard school of engineering and applied sciences researchers have concluded that by 2050 the number of wild˜res in the west could rise by  50 percent, and across the u.s. the number would double.osses in the united states, ˜˚˚˛-˜˚˝˙˝ (˜˚˛˝

conduct their daily operations, growing pools of personal and ˜nancial information are being transferred and stored online. this can leave individuals exposed to privacy violations, and ˜nancial institutions and other businesses exposed to potentially enormous liability, if and when a data security breach occurs. interest in cyber insurance and cyberrisk continues to grow as a result of high-pro˜le data breaches and awareness of the almost endless range of exposures businesses face. through november in 2018, 500 million records were exposed in november from marriott international; 340 million records were exposed in june from exactis, a marketing ˜rm; 150 million at under armour; 92 million at myheritage, a genealogy ˜rm; and 87 million records at facebook. in 2017 the largest u.s. credit bureau, equifax, su˚ered a breach that exposed the personal data of 145 million people, including social security numbers.  it was among the worst breaches on record because of the amount of sensitive information stolen. cyberattacks and breaches have grown in frequency, and losses are on the rise. breaches again hit a new record in 2017, with 1,579 breaches tracked, up 44.7 percent from 1,091 in 2016, according to the identity theft resource center (irtc). the number of records exposed rose to about 179 million, compared with 37 million in 2016. the majority of the data breaches in 2017 a˚ected the business sector, with 870 breaches or 55 percent of the total number of breaches. the business category su˚ered the most breaches for the third year in a row. medical/healthcare organizations were a˚ected by 374 breaches (23.7 percent of total breaches). the banking/credit/˜nancial sector ranked third as it sustained 134 breaches (8.5 percent of all breaches). these ˜gures do not include the many attacks that go unreported and undetected. despite con˛icting analyses, the costs associated with these losses are increasing. mcafee and the center for strategic and international studies (csis) estimated the likely annual cost to the global economy from cybercrime is $445 billion a year,  with a range of between $375 billion and $575 billion. in 2018 the itrc tracked 1,138 breaches through november. the number of records exposed totaled about  562 million. the business category continues to be the most a˚ected sector, with 524 breaches, or 46 percent of all breaches detected. the business sector breaches a˚ected 532 million records, or 95 percent of all records a˚ected. the cost of cybercrime is growing. the average cost of data breach globally was $3.86 million in 2018, up 6.4 percent from $3.62 million in 2017, according to a study from ibm and the ponemon institute. researchers polled 477 organizations to determine what costs they incurred after a data breach, including systems to help victims with losses and expenses, noti˜cation costs and lost business costs such as those associated with business disruption, revenue losses and reputation costs. the study also found that the average cost for each lost record rose 4.8 percent in 2018 from $141 to $148 and the average size of data breaches studied rose by 2.2 percent. in the united states, the average cost of a data breach was  $7.91 million. the united states had the highest average post data breach response cost: $1.76 million. cyber insurance evolved as a product in the united states in the mid- to late-1990s as insurers have had to expand coverage for a risk that is rapidly shifting in scope and nature. according to the national association of insurance commissioners, 170 u.s. insurers reported writing some cyber insurance premiums in 2017, based on the cybersecurity and identity theft coverage supplement for insurer ˜nancial statements. direct premiums written totaled $1.86 billion in 2017, at companies that can report premiums for stand-alone and coverage provided as part of a package policies.˝˙˙insurance information institute |

driving, thereby increasing the risk of accidents. marijuana is prohibited under the controlled substances act of 1970 (csa), which established a scheduling system for substances regulated under federal law. despite the regulation of marijuana under federal law, in 1996 california became the ˜rst state in the u.s. to pass legislation permitting a medical marijuana program. since then, more than 30 states and the district of columbia have passed legislation permitting comprehensive medical marijuana programs for qualifying patients to access marijuana and marijuana-related products. since 2012 several states have passed legislation permitting anyone over the age of 21 to possess and use marijuana, subject to certain limitations. most of those states also have or are developing regulations for a commercial market to support recreational marijuana sales.  although the magnitude of the increased risk is still a matter of study. a review from the wiley researcher academy found evidence that 20 to 30 percent of crashes involving marijuana occurred because of the marijuana use. this compares to roughly 85 percent of crashes involving alcohol that occurred because of alcohol use. the review estimated that the crash risk increased 22 percent while under the in˚uence of marijuana, controlling for concurrent alcohol use. another review found that someone driving under the in˚uence of marijuana is 1.65 times more likely to be culpable in a fatal accident. compared with marijuana, determining alcohol intoxication is relatively straightforward. alcohol is processed at a rate that allows blood alcohol concentration (bac) to closely correlate with intoxication, making it an eˆective and accurate benchmark for measuring impairment. unlike alcohol, thc (the active chemical that induces user intoxication from marijuana) levels in a user™s body may not be an accurate indication of impairment. moreover, thc is processed diˆerently than alcohol. the aaa foundation for tnoted that thc can remain in a user™s body for weeks after marijuana is consumed. thc levels spike immediately after consumption, but decline to low levels very quickly œ long before impairment ends. it is therefore not currently possible to accurately determine when a user consumed marijuana based on the thc levels in their body, and thc detection in a user post-accident does not necessarily no agreed-upon impairment limit above which an individual is indisputably impaired and no breathalyzer-equivalent for marijuana impairment. (see i.i.i.™s background on marijuana and impaired driving.) reports from the insurance institute for highway safety (iihs) and the highway loss data institute (hldi) con-clude that highway crashes have risen in states with legalized recreational use marijuana laws. in 2017 hldi released an analysis of insurance losses in colorado, oregon and washington that found that legalizing recreational marijuana use in the three states was associated with a combined 2.7 percent increase in the frequency of collision claims per insured vehicle year,relative to nearby control states without legalized recreational marijuana. in a 2018 report (download here), hldi estimates that the frequency of collision claims rose a combined 6 percent following the start of retail sales of recreational marijuana in colorado, nevada, oregon and washington, compared with the control states of idaho, montana, utah and wyoming. a 2018 iihs study examined police-reported crashes in 2012 to 2016 before and after retail sales began in colorado, oregon and washington. iihs estimates that the three states combined saw a 5.2 percent increase in the rate of crashes per million vehicle registrations, compared with neighboring states that didn't legalize marijuana sales.according to the iihs, the 5.2 percent increase in police-reported crash rates following legalization of recreational marijuana use is consistent with the 6 percent increase in insurance claim rates estimated by hldi.insurance information institute | www.iii.org 2019 insurance fact book 1938. lossesmotor vehicles: crashes\", 'aggressive drivingaggressive driving is a major factor in u rage, but in a large number of fatal highway collisions each year. the national highway t (nhtsa) de˜nes aggressive driving so as to endanger other persons or property., a 2009 study by the american automobile association reported that, based on data tracked by nhtsa™s fatal accident reporting system, aggressive driving played a role in 56 percent of fatal crashes from 2003 through 2007, with excessive speed being the no. 1 factor. speeding was also the leading driving behavior associated with fatal crashes in 2016 (17.8 percent), followed by driving under the in˚uence (10.8 percent), according to nhtsa.

airlines. commercial airlines ˚ying aircraft with fewer than 10 seats include commuter (scheduled) airlines and on-demand air taxis. general aviation includes all u.s.  noncommercial or privately

registered in the united states is projected to grow from 1.1 million units in 2017 to 2.4 million in 2022, according to the federal aviation administration (faa). commercial (small non-model drones) registrations totaled 110,604 in 2017 and are projected to grow to 451,800 in 2022. except for the eight-month period from may 2017 to december 2017, the faa required owners of hobbyist and commercial drones weighing more than 0.55 pounds and less than 55 pounds to register them and mark them with a registration number, beginning december 2015. larger dronesšweighing more than 55 poundsšmust register with the faa as traditional aircraft.insurance coverageif a drone is damaged in an accident it is most likely covered under a homeowners insurance policy (subject to a deductible). coverage also applies to renters insurance. the liability portion of a homeowners or renters policy may provide coverage against lawsuits for bodily injury or property damage that a policyholder causes to other people with a drone. it may also cover privacy issuesšfor example if a drone inadvertently takes pictures of or videotapes a neighbor who then sues the policyholder. it will not cover any intentional invasion of privacy. the policy will cover theft of a drone. damage or injuries caused by a drone used for commercial (i.e., business) purposes will not be covered by a homeowners policy. a no-fault medical coverage policy may provide no-fault medical coverage if someone is accidentally injured by a drone. however, this coverage will not pay medical bills for a policyholder™s family members or pets if they are injured by the policyholder™s drone. if a policyholder™s drone crash-lands into his or her car, damage may be covered under optional comprehensive insurance of an auto insurance policy. general liability insurance policies commonly contain exclusions for aviation activities. insurers are entering the market for drone insurance and creating coverage tailored to drones and their equipment. commercial drone opera-tors can purchase commercial aviation insurance to cover property damage and liability caused by a drone. the policy would cover the drone, its equipment and remote control systems. commercial aviation companies use underwriting processes similar to ones used for manned aircraft policies to cover drones.insurance information institute |

deception perpetrated against or by an insurance company or agent for the purpose , policyholders, third-party claimants or professionals who provide services to claimants. insurance agents and company employees may also commit insurance fraud. common frauds include padding, or in˜ating actual claims, misrepresenting facts on an insurance application, submitting claims for injuries or damage that never occurred and staging accidents.size of the problemthe e. in the late 1980s, the insurance information institute interviewed claims adjusters and concluded that fraud accounted for about 10 percent of the property/casualty insur-ance industry™s incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses each year. using this measure from 2013 to 2017, property/casualty fraud amounted to about $30 billion each year line of business, economic conditions and other factors. the nature of fraud is constantly evolving. insurance fraud is the second costliest white collar crime, according to the national insurance crime bureau s with insurers and law enforcement to identify, detect and prosecute insurance crime, including insurance fraud. the bureau fosters fraud awareness, see nicb.org. the insurance research council (irc) estimated that between $5.6 billion and $7.7 billion was fraudulently added to paid claims for auto insurance bodily injury payments in 2012, compared with a range of $4.3 billion to $5.8 billion in 2002. the irc studied more than 35,000 auto injury claims closed with payment and reported the results in its 2016 report, fraud and buildup in auto injury claims. fraud accounted for between 15 percent and 17 percent of total claims payments for auto insurance bodily injury.fighting insurance fraudinsurers are at the front line in combating insurance fraud despite the increase in the number of states that have passed laws to criminalize the practice. by 2016 every state and the district of columbia had enacted laws that classify fraud as a crime at least for some lines of insurance and have instituted immunity for reporting insurance fraud. forty-six states and the district of columbia had fraud bureaus or divisions where fraud can be reported, investigated and prosecuted. twenty-two states and the district of columbia required insurers to create and implement programs to reduce insur-ance fraud. many property/casualty insurers have created special investigative units within their companies. these use specially trained professionals to elike the nicb to catch perpetrators. one of the most e˚ective means of combating fraud is the adoption of data technologies that cut the time needed eep pace with sophis-ticated rings that constantly develop new scams. according to a company that develops insurance fraud analytics, insurers typically see evidence of organized staged accidents shortly after they start a direct internet channel for their customers. these websites allow criminals to exploit loopholes in consumer applications and underwriting and they test insurance information institute | www.iii.org ˛˙˝ˆ insurance fact book 9. factors affecting costsfraud', \" traditional approaches that concentrate on detection after payments are made (pay and chase programs) have been improved by predictive modeling, claims scoring and other tools that attempt to uncover fraud before a payment is made, while those with no suspicious elements are processed normally. data-mining programs that scan many insurance claims have been improved by the consolidation of insurance industry claims databases, such as iso's claimsearch, the world™s largest comprehensive database of claims information. systems that identify anomalies in a database can be used to develop algorithms that enable an insurer to automatically stop claim payments. an insurance technology expert said that this approach has produced 20 to 50 percent reductions in fraud loss for some insurers. newer programs that analyze patterns and text, such as adjuster notes, can search various kinds of data formats for key terms and word patterns. investigators scan social media sites such as facebook, twitter and youtube when they examine workers compensation claims. in 2016 the coalition against insurance fraud and the sas institute published a report entitled, state of insurance fraud technology, to track how insurers deploy technology to combat insurance fraud. an online survey of 86 insurers found that in 2016, 61 percent of the survey participants said suspected fraud has increased to some degree in the past three years, compared with 51 percent in 2014. the coalition asked whether fraud is increasing, or if insurers are getting better at detecting it, in part through increased use of technology. by 2016 almost 75 percent of insurers polled had fully integrated technology into their anti-fraud systems, compared with roughly half in 2012. by primary use, insurers say claims fraud detection technology is the most popular, as 76 percent of insurers use this technology compared with 65 percent in the last four years. the most commonly employed method used by insurers is automated red ˜ags, which are used by 90 percent of the respondents, up from 64 percent in the last four years.insurance information institute | www.iii.org ˛˙˝ˆ insurance fact book \", 'litigiousnessinsurers™ legal defense costslawsuits against
